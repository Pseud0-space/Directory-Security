# Directory-Security
A python program to keep your files safe and secured

python3 DirSec.py --dir "/home/pseudo/Desktop/CODING/projects/local_noSQL/"
The path is where the program will create a directory called 'Locker'.
--After running the program for the first time it will take a root password to authorise one user and will create a 'SecOps.json' file for storing some config.
--If the json file is deleted or removed and your folder is already encrypted say goodbye to all the files, as it is AES 256bit encrypted and without that file its not impossible to decrypt the data back
--Now Encrypt or Decrypt [Program will decide that, depending on if the folder is encrypted or decrypted] Enjoy!

Disclaimer:-
I won't be responsible if you are unable to decrypt the data back, so USE IT AT YOUR RISK.
